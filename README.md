How to run the code:
nodejs has to be installed
got to the project folder on command line
- npm i
- npm run dev

Filters Ui has been added and there is no logic since there is no support for the same on the endpoint , but if to implement based
on selection the appropiate api call can be made and fetched accordingly 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
